*
* <br>All API endpoints are documented below.
* <br> You can try out any query in realtime using our interactive API.<br>
* Most of the methods require API key authorization since they provide a specific permission level for the each user.
* Thus, we recommend you first to be granted with valid API key assigned by relevant role (permission). You can use this API key across all service API endpoints.

* Validation for the object entities is handled by scalecube services and do the next upon the request object:
* - ignores any excessive keys and values added besides the required parameters
* - doesn't ignore the keys duplicates and takes the last values which applied for each of the relevant key duplicate
