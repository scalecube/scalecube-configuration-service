Feature: Integration tests for configuration service - updateEntry.

  Only the managers with "Owner" and "Admin" API keys roles should be able to update the specific entries in the related Repository.

  Background: repositories with entries are stored in the system and having apiKeys
    Given organizations with specified names "Org-1" and "Org-2" already created
    And related apiKeys with "Owner", "Admin" and "Member" roles are stored in Organization "Org-1"
      | apiKey       |
      | Owner-Org-1  |
      | Admin-Org-1  |
      | Member-Org-1 |
    And related apiKeys with "Owner" and "Admin" roles are stored in Organization "Org-2"
      | apiKey      |
      | Owner-Org-2 |
      | Admin-Org-2 |
    And repository with name "Repo-1" related to organization "Org-1" created with {"version":1} per each key
      | repository | key                        | value | instrumentId | name   | DecimalPrecision | Rounding |
      | Repo-1     | KEY-FOR-PRECIOUS-METAL-123 |       | XAG          | Silver | 4                | down     |
    And repository with name "Repo-2" related to organization "Org-2" created with {"version":1} per each key
      | repository | key                        | value | instrumentId | name   | DecimalPrecision | Rounding |
      | Repo-2     | KEY-FOR-PRECIOUS-METAL-123 |       | XAG          | Silver | 4                | down     |


  #UPDATE ENTRY

  #21
  Scenario: Successful updateEntry by one of the identical keys in the different Repositories applying the "Owner" API key
    When the user requested to updateEntry in the repository name "Repo-1" with following details
      | apiKey      | repository | key                        | value | instrumentId | name   | DecimalPrecision | Rounding |
      | Owner-Org-1 | Repo-1     | KEY-FOR-PRECIOUS-METAL-123 |       | XAG          | Silver | 4                | down     |

    Then new entries related for the existing "key" should be stored in the "Repo-1" which belongs to organization "Org-1"
    And for each request user should get the successful response with new version for each entry
      | version |
      | 2       |
      | 3       |
    But any entry in the repository "Repo-1" shouldn't be overwritten for related key "KEY-FOR-PRECIOUS-METAL-123"
      | version | value | instrumentId | name   | DecimalPrecision | Rounding |
      | 1       |       | XAG          | Silver | 4                | down     |

    And existent entry in the repository name "Repo-2" related to organization "Org-2" shouldn't be updated
      | key                        | value | instrumentId | name   | DecimalPrecision | Rounding |
      | KEY-FOR-PRECIOUS-METAL-123 |       | XAG          | Silver | 4                | down     |
